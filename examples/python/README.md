# RHD2000 Python example

## General description

This example shows how to use the RHD2000 lib in Python projects. This example is mostly useful to _show how to use librhd with Python's CFFI_. The example does the exact same things as the _C example_.

TODO both ABI and API modes of CFFI are shown.

## Running

**Execute the scripts from the repo's root !**

To generate `librhd.so` and `libcffi_rw.so`, run `build_so.sh` located in this directory.

To compile and run the script, feel free to use `run.sh` located in this directory.

To compile and run the in-line ABI example, you may use `run_e2e.sh` (end-to-end).
